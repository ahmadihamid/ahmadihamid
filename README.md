### Hi there 🙋‍♂️ Assalamualaikum 😙

Honestly I don't even know why I'm here on `😼GitHub`. I'm no `👨‍💻Programmer`. For living I work as a `👨‍🔬Chemist`. I even fail my Computer Science degree. **Two times!** 🤪
Lastly if any of you still curious about me please found me at 📝<https://ahmadiham.id> or 🌱[https://t.me/halamanbelakang](@halamanbelakang]).
